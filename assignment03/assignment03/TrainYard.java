/**
 * This is the entry point for Assignment 3, CS1027A, 2019. 
 * 
 * This program will take as a command line argument the name of a file containing the cars in a train.
 * This program will parse the train file and add the train cars into a queue. 
 * Students need to complete the 'buildTrain()' method, which adds TrainCars into the train in the 
 * correct way.
